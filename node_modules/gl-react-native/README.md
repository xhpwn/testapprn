========

`gl-react-native` is the [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)  implementation of [gl-react](https://github.com/gre/gl-react). It is backed by [react-native-webgl](https://github.com/gre/react-native-webgl) which implements WebGL in React Native (If you are using Expo, it is recommended to use `gl-react-expo` instead).

## Install

To use this library, you will need install `gl-react` and `gl-react-native` which are pure JS libraries.
For the native WebGL implementation, you also need to install `react-native-webgl`, please refer to the [README / Install](https://github.com/gre/react-native-webgl#install).
